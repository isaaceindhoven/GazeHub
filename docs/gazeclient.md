# GazeClient

[GazeClient](https://github.com/isaaceindhoven/GazeClient) is the frontend library for [Gaze](gaze.md) that allows the browser to connect to the [GazeHub](gazehub.md).

## Installation

GazeClient can be installed using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) with the following command:

```bash
npm install --save @isaac.frontend/gaze-client
```

## Usage

### Connecting as guest

Below you see an example of creating a connection with the hub using GazeClient.

```javascript
const gaze = new GazeClient('https://hub.myapplication.com');
await gaze.connect();
```

### Connecting with roles

It may occur that you only want specific events to be received by a certain role.
For this you can use the `setToken` method. The expected token is a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/). The JWT needs to be generated by the PHP application using the [GazePublisher](gazepublisher.md) library.

```javascript
const tokenRequest = await fetch('/token');
const tokenRequestJson = await tokenRequest.json();

const gaze = new GazeClient('https://hub.myapplication.com');
await gaze.connect();
await gaze.setToken(tokenRequestJson.token);
```

### Subscriptions

Gaze makes use of subscriptions to subscribe to topics. Each subscription is associated with its callback function. Subscription can be made in three different ways, below are all three listed with examples.

```javascript
// Subscribe to a single topic
gaze.on('topic1', payload => {});

// Subscribe to multiple topics
gaze.on(['topic1', 'topic2'], payload => {});

// Subscribe dynamically to topics (the topic callback)
function getTopics() {
	const rows = [...document.querySelectorAll('.row')]
	return rows.map(r => 'topic' + r.getAttribute('data-id')); // ['topic1', 'topic2', 'topic3']
}
const subscription = await gaze.on(getTopics, payload => {});

// To update the subscription, call .update()
// This will call the given topic callback and 
// automatically subscribe and unsubscribe to the right topics.
// Can be used when, for example, navigating to another page on a SPA.
subscription.update();
```

#### Unsubscribe / unmount

You can use the `destroy` method on a subscription to unsubscribe from all topics. This is useful in a Single Page Application when you unmount a component or page, for example.

```javascript
// Vue 3 example
onUnmounted(() => {
	subscription.destroy();
})

// React example
componentWillUnmount() {
	subscription.destroy();
}
```

## Development

GazeClient is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to transpile to JavaScript. You can use to following commands:

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `npm install` | Installs all the dependencies. |
| `npm run build` | Builds GazeClient for production. Output is stored in `./dist`. |
| `npm run dev` | Builds GazeClient for development, without minification. Output is stored in `./dist`. |
| `npm run lint` | Run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to validate coding guidelines. |
| `npm run test` | Run [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) unit-tests to validate the working of GazeClient. |
