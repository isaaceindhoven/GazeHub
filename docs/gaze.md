The modern web offers a lot of protocols to achieve realtime communication. Unfortunately, there are no plug-and-play solutions to integrate easily into an existing project. This is the problem that Gaze solves. Gaze is a library that can be used for realtime server-to-client communication in a PHP project. It is split up into three modules: [GazeHub](gazehub.md), [GazeClient](gazeclient.md) and [GazePublisher](gazepublisher.md). See the [Complete install](complete-install.md) page for a detailed guide of how to install Gaze.
